                Hello! I'm <strong>Sanjeev Ladwal</strong>, a passionate and driven student currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor's in Engineering (B.E.)</strong> in the field of <strong>Information Technology</strong> at <strong>MBM University Jodhpur, Rajasthan</strong>. My journey began in 2022 and I am set to complete my degree in 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally from the beautiful <strong>Kathua District, Jakhbar Village</strong> in Jammu and Kashmir, I have always been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform the world. Over the years, I have developed a strong interest in computer programming and web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My skill set includes languages like:
                <span class="language-symbol">C</span>, 
                <span class="language-symbol">C++</span>, 
                <span class="language-symbol">Python</span>, 
                and I specialize in <strong>Front-End Web Development</strong>. I am passionate about creating user-friendly websites and applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am constantly learning new technologies and improving my skills to stay at the forefront of the industry. I believe in the power of innovation and aim to solve real-world problems through creative software solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, reading tech blogs, and participating in coding challenges to test my problem-solving abilities. My goal is to make meaningful contributions to the tech community and build tools that make life easier.
